Jetson/Orbitty Crib
===================

Designed by NASA LaRC for the Jetson TX2 using the ConnectTech Orbitty carrier board. I ended up cutting out one or two of the slats on the side where the U.FL wifi radio connectors are for easy access to those connectors and the SD card. I also had to remove some of the material in the inner corners so that the orbitty/tx2 would sit nicely.

I did not end up using any screws in the crib -- in fact I just used electrical tape on the top to keep it shut :).

The STL files are scaled 1:1 and can be sent directly to the shop for printing.
