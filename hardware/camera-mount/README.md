Fixed Camera Mount
==================

Designed by NASA specifically for the S2D2 project. It is fixed at a 45&deg; elevation angle. By sending the two `*.stl` files and the measurement pdf to the BYU ECEn shop, they can print the two pieces of the camera mount. It is best if printed using PLA (instead of ABS).

The dimensions are given in inches. The dimensions of the camera (UI-1250ML) are: 44.0 x 44.0 x 28.0 (mm) or in inches: 1.732 x 1.732 x 1.102 (in).
